This is the first part of the Deep Learning Course for the Master in High-Performance Computing (SISSA/ICTP):
**Introduction to Neural Networks**.

You can find [here](https://github.com/denocris/MHPC-Natural-Language-Processing-Lectures-2020) the second part of the course, **Natural Language Processing**, by Cristiano De Nobili.


### Main Topics

**First Part**

- Artificial neural networks
- Train, validate and test a deep learning model
- Convolutional neural networks
- Brief remarks on unsupervised models

**Second Part**

- Natural Language Processing
- Transformers and contextual word embeddings
- PyTorch, SpaCy and Hugging Face libraries

# Teachers

- Alessio Ansuini (AREA Science Park)
- Cristiano De Nobili (SAMSUNG)

Follow-up

- Piero Coronica (University of Cambridge)

# Detailed Syllabus of the First Part

**Day 1**

- The artificial neuron, activation functions, capacity of a single neuron
- The limits of a single neuron, transformations of the input: the concept of 
representation
- Fully connected architectures, exact count and scaling of the number of parameters
- Universal approximation theorem (sketched)
- Softmax, probabilistic interpretation of the output, discriminative models
- Cross-entropy loss, probabilistic interpretation as maximum-likelihood inference,
information-theoretical interpretation as KL distance between the probability of 
the data and the model
- Optimization and learning rules for gradient descent and its stochastic counterparts 
- Regularization L2, L1 and their influence on training dynamics

**Day 2** 

- Representations as a scientific object of investigation
- More on regularization: dropout
- Convolutional networks: convolutional layers, pooling layers
- Transfer learning

**Day 3**

- Basics of autoencoders, linear autoencoders: relationship with PCA (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq-I0Rl8mt0) for a proof)
- Description of the exam: [Deconstructing the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis](https://eng.uber.com/deconstructing-lottery-tickets/)
  More resources are embedded in the notebook for the exam!


# Exam

The exam will consist in an exploration of a recent finding on network pruning
called "The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis"

# Resources

There are excellent free resources to deepen your knowledge
on topics such as Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and more
in general Artificial Intelligence.

Here is a selection of a few of these. This selection will
be updated in the next days/weeks.
